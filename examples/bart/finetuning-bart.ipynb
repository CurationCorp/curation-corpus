    "# Finetuning BART for abstractive text summarisation with fastai2\n",
    "\n",
    "A great thing about working in NLP at the moment is being able to park a hard problem for a few weeks and discovering the community making massive amounts of progress on your behalf. I used to be overwhelmed by the challenge of just training a summarisation model to generate plausible looking text without burning through tonnes of cash on GPUs. Then [BertExtAbs](../finetuning-bertsumextabs) came along and solved that problem. Unfortunately, it still gernerated incoherent sentences sometimes and had a habit of confusing entities in an article. You certainly couldn't trust it to convey the facts of an article reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers). Here we have a model that generates staggeringly good summaries and has a wonderful implementation from Sam Shleifer at HuggingFace. It's still a work in progress, but after digging around in the Transformers pull requests and with help from [Morgan McGuire's FastHugs notebook](https://github.com/morganmcg1/fasthugs) I have put together this notebook for fine-tuning BART and generating summaries. Feedback welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "I should mention that this a big model requiring big inputs. For fine-tuning I've been able to get a batch size of 4 and a maximum sequence length of 512 on an AWS P3.2xlarge (~£4 an hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a bunch of imports and an args object for storing variables we will need. We'll be finetuning the model on the Curation Corpus of abstractive text summaries. We load it into a dataframe using Pandas. For more information about how to access this dataset for your own purposes please see our [article introducing the dataset](https://medium.com/curation-corporation/teaching-an-ai-to-abstract-a-new-dataset-for-abstractive-auto-summarisation-5227f546caa8)."
